# Puzzle
This is a template for a puzzle game written in Java.
I built this project for my CSCI 1103 class at UMN Twin Cities.  The main skills utilized in this project are arrays and methods.  The point of this template is to resemble a tile puzzle game, where the user is to move the tiles around to end up with the tiles in number order.
